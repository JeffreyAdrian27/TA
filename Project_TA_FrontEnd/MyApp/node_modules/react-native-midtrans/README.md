1. Checkout: Customer clicks the Checkout button on the Host application and the app makes a request to the Merchant Server
2. Token request: Merchant Server makes a request to Veritrans server with Order Information.
3. Token response: Midtrans responds with a valid transaction token to Merchant server
4. Token response: Merchant server forwards the token to the Mobile SDK
5. Get transaction options: Mobile SDK requests payment/merchant information based on the token
6. Transaction options response: Mobile SDK renders the payment Options and payment information to make the payment
7. Pay: Customers selects the payment method and the payment details and clicks “Pay”
8. Charge: Mobile SDK sends the Charge request to the Veritrans Backend for payment Processing.
9. Charge response: Mobile SDK receives the response from the Veritrans Backend and triggers the handler on Mobile App with success/failure/pending status
10. Charge notification: Midtrans Backend sends a notification to the Merchant backend confirming the completion of transaction.

# Prerequisites
* Create a merchant account in [MAP](https://account.midtrans.com)
* In MAP, setup your merchant accounts settings, in particular Notification URL.
* Setup your merchant server. A server side implementation is required for midtrans mobile SDK to work. You can check the server implementation [reference](https://gitik.cybermantra.net/mucasali/expaymentbackend/tree/master), and walk through the API’s that you may need to implement on your backend server.
* Minimum requirements for Android

`TransactionResult` is wrapper for UI flow finished transaction object. It contains:

> status : either `canceled`, `pending`, `success`, `failed` or `invalid` based on payment API.

* status *canceled* is value if transaction canceled. for example when selecting payment method users click back
* status: *pending* will be only use on asynchronous transaction like bank transfer or internet banking.
* status *success* / *failed*: For synchronous transaction you can immediately know the status of the transaction.
* status *invalid* : There are unknown error happened.
